//! Broadcast LoRa node: originates frames, receives everyone else's, and
//! optionally repeats them.
//!
//! The network has no routing and no join procedure. Every node transmits
//! [`midair_proto::lora::Frame`] broadcasts and listens continuously, so a
//! fleet of nothing but [`Role::Leaf`] nodes already works - each hears
//! whichever others are in direct range. A [`Role::Repeater`] is a node
//! placed to extend that range: it retransmits frames that still carry
//! hops, and is the only thing that has to be configured differently.
//!
//! [`Role::TxOnly`] and [`Role::RxOnly`] drop one half of that. Position
//! reporting is one-way, so a node that is only ever tracked can keep its
//! receiver off and a node that only collects can stay off the air - each
//! saving the power the unused half would cost.
//!
//! Two mechanisms keep repeating from turning into a broadcast storm:
//!
//! - **Deduplication.** A frame is identified by `(src, id)`. One that has
//!   been seen recently is neither delivered again nor repeated again, so a
//!   frame that reaches a node by two paths is handled once and a repeater
//!   pair cannot bounce a frame between themselves.
//! - **Jittered forwarding.** A repeat is queued with a random delay rather
//!   than sent from inside the receive path. Two repeaters that heard the
//!   same broadcast would otherwise transmit simultaneously and collide
//!   every single time; the delay also keeps the radio out of a blocking
//!   transmit while more of the same burst is still arriving.
